## Thoughts about my own template

- Be careful about namespaces

- there could be call to empty partials inside partials as head. All this because ancestor easily can use them to extend functionality.
  - it should be appropriate input parameters
  - there should be returned values, if it's needed
- possibilities to add custom taxonomies like "8 years old" 100 days since
